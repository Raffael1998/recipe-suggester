# Recipe Suggester

A simple Streamlit app that suggests recipes based on a user's request.
Requests can be provided by typing or via voice recording which is
converted to text using OpenAI's speech-to-text API. The lists of
available ingredients and utensils are read from local text files and
included in the prompt sent to ChatGPT.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create two files in the project directory:
   - `main_ingredients.txt`
   - `ustensiles.txt`

Each file should contain one item per line. These files are excluded
from version control so you can customize them for your own kitchen.

Example `main_ingredients.txt`:

```
sel
poivre
huile d'olive
oignon
ail
pates
riz
```

Example `ustensiles.txt`:

```
rape à fromage
coupe-légumes à grille
mixeur
thermomix
```

3. Export your OpenAI API key so the app can access the API:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Running the app

Run the Streamlit application with

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the provided local URL in your browser. Describe what you want
to cook or record a voice request and the app will display a recipe
suggestion generated by ChatGPT using your base ingredients and
utensils.
