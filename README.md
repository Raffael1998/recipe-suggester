# Recipe Suggester

A simple Streamlit app that suggests recipes based on a user's request. You can
record your request directly in the browser or type it. The lists of available
ingredients and utensils are stored in text files that can be edited directly
below the request section of the app.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create two files in the project directory:
   - `main_ingredients.txt`
   - `ustensiles.txt`

Each file should contain one item per line. These files are excluded from
version control so you can customize them for your own kitchen.

Example `main_ingredients.txt`:

```
sel
poivre
huile d'olive
oignon
ail
pates
riz
```

Example `ustensiles.txt`:

```
rape à fromage
coupe-légumes à grille
mixeur
thermomix
```

3. Export your OpenAI API key so the app can access the API:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Running the app

Run the Streamlit application with

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the provided local URL in your browser. Record or type your request
and the app will display a recipe suggestion generated by ChatGPT using your
base ingredients and utensils. Microphone capture uses Streamlit's
`st.audio_input`, so be sure to allow microphone access in your
browser. After you record a request, the recognized speech text is
displayed below the recorder. You can manage your ingredient and utensil
lists from the main interface below the request section.
